# Growth of Functions
keywords: #algorithms #foundations

The order of growth of the running time of an algorithm gives a simple characterization of the algorithmâ€™s efficiency and also allows us to compare the relative performance of alternative algorithms.

### Asymptotic notation
We will use asymptotic notation primarily to describe the running times of algorithms.
