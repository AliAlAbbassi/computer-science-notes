### Question
Guys planted duckweed in a pond, it grows exponentially and takes 14 days to fill the whole pond. How long does it take to cover half the pond?

### Answer
It doubles everyday, so on day 13, it was half full because it'd double the next day and then it's full.

### Take aways
- Exponential growth bad
- expo growth isn't very intuitive
- factorial growth is prbbly even more bad

### Question
How long would it take if they planted two duckweeds at the opposite sides?

### Answer
13 days cz it needs 13 days to cover half and if we have 2 then each plant would cover its own portion

### weird stuff
If all the planet surface was just water and planted duckweed, it'd take  

first 2 weeks, we go from 6cm^2 to 10m^2 which is covering the entire pond  
another 2 weeks, and it's enough to cover a uni campus   
another 2 weeks, and it covers europe  
another 2 weeks, and it covers the whole planet  

It'd cover the whole galaxy in 47 weeks
