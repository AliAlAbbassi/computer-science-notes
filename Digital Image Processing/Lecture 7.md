# Image Segmentation With Thresholding
keywords: #imageprocessing #segmentation

### Segmentation
Is a partitioning into connected regions, where each region is homogeneous and identified by a unique label. 
**goal**: Identify groups of pixels that go well together.

Let R represent the entire spatial region occupied by an image. Image segmentation is a process that partitions R into n sub-regions, R1 , R2 , …, Rn , such that

Partitioning an image into regions that are similar according to a set of predefined criteria. 
- Lots of room for interpretation 
- Possible meanings: 
	- All pixels are the “same” brightness 
	- Close to some representative (mean) brightness 
	- Color 
	- Motion 
	- Texture 
	- Generically & formally:  
		- The values of each pixel are consistent with having been generated by a particular model
