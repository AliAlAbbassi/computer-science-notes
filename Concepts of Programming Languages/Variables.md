keywords: #copl 
A variable can be characterized as a sextuple of attributes: (name, address, value, type, lifetime, and scope).

### Name
A name is a string for some entity program such as variables. Read more in [[Names]]

### Address
The address of a variable is the machine memory address with which it is associated.

It is possible to have multiple variables that have the same address. Which in this case these variables would be called "aliases".

### Types
The type of a variable determines the range of values the variable can store and the set of operations that are defined for values of the type. 

For example, the int type in Java specifies a value range of âˆ’2147483648 to 2147483647 and arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

### Value
The value of a variable is the contents of the memory cell or cells associated with the variable.
